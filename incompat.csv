implicit cast from void* to other pointer types
no true boolean type
designated initializers for structs and arrays
use of C++ keywords as identifiers
inner struct scope
"non-prototype (""K&R""-style) function declarations"
"structs, unions, or enums with the same name"
VLAs (and non-compile time sizeof)
implicit conversion from int to enum types
all file-scoped entities are extern by default
lack of const std lib overloads
character literals are of type int
flexible array members
enum values always stored as ints
array parameter qualifiers
implicit const discard on pointer assignment
uninitialized const variables
complex primitive data types
goto or switch crossing an initialization
multiple tentative defs of a single global var in a single translation unit
inline and extern definitions of the same function
"struct, union, and enum types declared in function prototypes"
never UB on longjmp() (as in C++ with nontrivial destructors)
